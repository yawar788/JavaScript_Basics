// Step-by-Step Guide
// Make a Fetch Request: You initiate a fetch request to the API endpoint.

// Handle the Response: Once the response is received, you use the json() method to convert the response into a JavaScript object.

// Handle Any Errors: It's good practice to handle any potential errors that might occur during the fetch operation.

// Here's a complete example:

// Function to fetch data from an API and handle JSON response
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    // Make a GET request to the API
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    
    // Check if the response is okay (status is in the range 200-299)
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }

    // Parse the JSON from the response
    const data = await response.json();
    
    // Log the parsed data
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during the fetch
    console.error('Fetch error:', error);
  }
}

// Call the function to fetch data
fetchData();

Explanation
fetch('https://api.example.com/data'): This initiates a GET request to the specified URL.

await response.json(): This converts the response body into a JavaScript object. The json() method returns a promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON.

if (!response.ok) { throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); }: This checks if the response status is okay (i.e., within the range 200-299). If not, it throws an error.

console.log(data): This logs the parsed JSON data to the console.

catch (error) { console.error('Fetch error:', error); }: This catches any errors that occur during the fetch and logs them.
