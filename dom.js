// What is DOM ? 

// The Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript is a programming interface for web documents. 
// It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects that can be manipulated via 
// JavaScript. Each element in the HTML becomes an object that can be accessed and modified to
// dynamically change the document's structure, style, and content.
